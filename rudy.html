          <h3>Hacking generally refers to unauthorized intrusion into a computer or a network</h3>
          
           <h1>what is a hacker</h1>
<h3>The basic definition of a hacker is someone who uses a computer system to gain unauthorized access to another system for data or who<br>
makes another system unavailable. These hackers will use their skills for a specific goal, such as stealing money, gaining fame by bringing<br>
down a computer system, or making a network unavailable -- even sometimes destroying them. However, there are three different types<br>
of hackers, each with a particular goal, and not all are the bad guys<br>
The three types of hackers are the white hat hacker, the grey hat hacker, and the black hat hacker. Each type of hacker hacks for a different reason, a cause,<br>
            or both. All have the required skills needed to accomplish their mission. At one end of the spectrum is the black hat,<br>
            who hacks for evil and malicious intent and without permission. On the other end of the spectrum is the white hat, <br>
            who hacks against a black hat in order to protect computer and network access and has the company's permission to do so. In the middle <br>
            the grey hat, who hacks not for evil and not for good; they are neutral in their cause and usually try to sell their skills for monetary gain, like a mercenary.<br>

                              <li>grey hat hacker-has a choice to be either white or black hat hacker/a normal hacker</li><br>
                              <li>white hat hacker-good hacker/hero</li> <br>

      device if some hacker knows your ip the can hack you if you dont have a updated fairewall and antivirus but I am not a hacker so dont worry and file a<br>
      case on me . these types of links can also be in secure sites so be careful
